    "## Goal\n",
    "### How DFS Works\n",
    "In many cases (and traditionally), the variability of outcomes in baseball is such that projections regarding the performance of a pitcher or batter require hundreds of events in order to reach some level of confidence.  Because of this, most effort in projecting the performance of a particular hitter attempts to do so over a full season.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS), the goal is to choose an optimal lineup for a particular day. Typically a contestant chooses a lineup (one first baseman, one second baseman, two pitchers, three outfielders, etc.), drawing from a pool that includes every single player in Major League Baseball (MLB). The stats (e.g., hits, home runs, strikeouts) accumulated __that day__ by the selected lineup are summed according to rules of the DFS game and the most points wins. In addition, each player in the pool is assigned a 'salary' by the DFS game (with better players having higher salaries). The total salary of the contestant's selected team cannot exceed some limit. This prevents contestants from just choosing all of the best players.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given this, the problem is: navigate the 'salary' constraints and construct the lineup likely to score the most points that day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Choose a Good Team\n",
    "Multiple factors go into choosing a good team.  There are a handful that I ultimately want to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The matchup. If the best batter in the league is facing the best pitcher in the league while the second-best batter is facing the worst pitcher, it seems obvious that the second-best batter is the superior selection.\n",
    "* Non-game factors.  Weather, umpire, game start time.  It is proven that umpires call different strike zones which impact the game.  Batted balls with the same launch angle and velocity fly further when it is warm and humid.  Batters swing more frequently on Sundays.\n",
    "* Variability. The most popular formats with the largest prizes have tens of thousands of contestants. The goal isn't to find the lineup with the highest median point score, the goal is to pick the lineup that most likely to have a bunch of outliers so that you finish first and win the big prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Goal\n",
    "Ok, so a lot of this is vague and beyond me.  But, I'm starting somewhere and I decided to start with matchups. My goal is to try to exploit \"pitcher-vs-batter\" or 'PvB' stats.  In most cases, these stats are not statistically significant because the two players have only faced each other a handful of times. Knowing that pitcher A has struckout batter B in their two previous matchups really isn't valuable. Most contestants disregard these statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that if I can generate a set of \"pitcher archetypes\" that I can build \"pitcher-archetype-vs-batter\" statistics that might have some actual predictive value.  This is all based on a theory that - given enough data points - a batter would have the same wOBA against all pitchers belonging to a single \"pitcher archetype\"."

    "## Work So Far\n",
    "Ok, none of this is \"operationalized\". I'm just messing around. You'll also notice that I've only used data from 2019 even though I have three years of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `pitchertest` Notebook\n",
    "The first thing that I did is build a matrix where each row is a pitcher and the columns contain:\n",
    "* the pitcher's id\n",
    "* the handedness\n",
    "* and then for each of 9 different pitches (e.g., Two-Seam Fastball, Curveball) there 17 different attributes (e.g., release point, velocity, acceleration in each of x, y, and z dimensions).  these values have all been standardized.\n",
    "* and also for each of the 9 different pitches, the percentage of times that the pitcher throws that pitch (pct_usage).\n",
